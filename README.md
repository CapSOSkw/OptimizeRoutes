## OptimizeRoutes

Use K means and Simulated Annealing to schedule routes such that it would cost less time or distance!
But the problem is how to find the best K value. 
Due to the disadvantage of K means algorithm, it could exist a scenario that one cluster has many points while another is sparse. 
It would lead to a result that one car has to pick up more customers (points) than the other cars. Thus, trying to find out a better K value is the next step.
